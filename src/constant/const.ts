    description:
      "My experience building KamiSketch, a real-time drawing battle game with AI judging, at the Isek.ai Hackathon at Taylor's University.",
    content: `I recently participated in the Isek.ai Hackathon at Taylor's University alongside my teammate Nik Zulfaqar. The hackathon theme was anime + AI + game + card, which sparked our creativity and led us to build something fun and innovative.

## The Idea: KamiSketch

We created **KamiSketch** — a real-time drawing battle game similar to skribbl.io but with a tournament format. What makes it unique? The judge is OpenAI. Players compete in drawing challenges, and AI evaluates their artwork in real-time, creating an engaging and competitive experience.

## The Hackathon Experience

This was my second hackathon, and I learned a valuable lesson the hard way: **don't sleep too comfortably on day 1**. We overslept, and day 2 became pure struggle mode as we tried to catch up. 😅

Despite the setback, we pushed through. Thanks to Brendan Beh and Edward Low for their encouragement and for pushing us to not give up and keep going. With the power of vibe coding (and Claude Sonnet 4.5 backing us), we still managed to finish our prototype in time.

## The Most Satisfying Moment

The most rewarding part of the entire experience was seeing the judges and participants enjoying testing our app live. That already felt like a mini win for me. Even though we didn't hit top 3, it was a good lesson and honestly a very enjoyable experience.

## Going Open Source

We've decided to make KamiSketch open source so anyone can try it, clone it, play with it, and continue building ideas on top of it. 

**Repository:** [KamiSketch on GitHub](https://github.com/faizzmarzuki/kamisketch)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Time Management Matters**: Don't underestimate the importance of staying on schedule, especially in hackathons where every hour counts.

2. **Support is Crucial**: Having mentors and teammates who push you forward makes all the difference when things get tough.

3. **AI as a Judge**: Using OpenAI to judge drawings added a unique twist that made the game more engaging and innovative.

4. **Open Source Impact**: Making the project open source allows others to learn, contribute, and build upon our work.

## What's Next?

We're not stopping here. More to come from this direction. 🚀

The hackathon experience taught us valuable lessons about rapid prototyping, teamwork, and pushing through challenges. KamiSketch is just the beginning of what we can build when we combine creativity, AI, and gaming.

    description:
      "My experience building ReadPal AI at the Lovable Hackathon — an AI reading buddy that helps kids practice reading with real-time feedback and gamified progress.",
    content: `# Building ReadPal AI: An AI Reading Buddy in 3.5 Hours

Just wrapped up the Lovable Hackathon at UOB Plaza 1, and in just **3½ hours**, I built something close to my heart: **ReadPal AI** — an AI reading buddy that helps kids aged 4–13 practice reading aloud with real-time feedback, gamified progress, and parent tracking.

## The Problem

Many children struggle with reading practice, especially when:
- Parents have limited time to sit with their children
- Parents have limited literacy themselves
- Children need consistent, patient feedback to improve

Traditional reading practice requires a parent or teacher to be present, which isn't always possible. This creates a gap in learning opportunities for many children.

## The Solution: ReadPal AI

**ReadPal AI** is an AI-powered reading companion that provides:

- **Real-time Feedback**: As children read aloud, the AI listens and provides immediate feedback on pronunciation, fluency, and comprehension
- **Gamified Progress**: Children earn points, badges, and unlock new stories as they improve
- **Parent Tracking**: Parents can monitor their child's progress, see reading statistics, and track improvement over time — even when they can't be physically present

## Technical Implementation

Building this in 3.5 hours required careful planning and the right tools:

### OpenAI Integration
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converting stories and prompts into natural-sounding audio
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribing children's reading attempts accurately
- **AI Feedback Engine**: Analyzing reading performance and providing constructive feedback

### Stripe Payment Gateway
Integrated a subscription model to make the platform sustainable while keeping core features accessible.

### Rapid Development
Using Lovable's platform allowed me to focus on the core functionality and user experience rather than boilerplate code, which was crucial for such a tight timeline.

## The Hackathon Experience

The Lovable Hackathon was intense but incredibly rewarding. The 3.5-hour constraint forced me to:
- Prioritize core features over nice-to-haves
- Make quick decisions about what truly mattered
- Focus on creating a working prototype that demonstrated the concept

## Why This Matters

Reading is fundamental to learning, and every child deserves access to quality reading practice. **ReadPal AI** addresses a real need by:

1. **Accessibility**: Available 24/7, regardless of parent availability
2. **Consistency**: Provides uniform, patient feedback every time
3. **Engagement**: Gamification keeps children motivated to practice
4. **Transparency**: Parents stay informed about their child's progress

## What's Next?

This hackathon project has the potential to become a full-scale application. The positive feedback and the clear need for such a tool make it worth exploring further.

**Check it out:** [ReadPal AI](https://readpal-ai-voices.lovable.app/)

The experience taught me that with the right tools and a clear vision, you can build meaningful solutions even under extreme time constraints. Sometimes, constraints force creativity and focus that lead to better outcomes.`,
